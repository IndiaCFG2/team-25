<div class="main">We started in 2012 by opening a school for children from low-income communities in Mumbai. Our experience in running the school led us to understand the value that high quality teaching brings to a child's learning in school. The urgency for having more confident and empowered educators across schools led us to build customized programs for our teachers.<br><br>
	Our name captures our culture and all the principles that are important to us

<br><b>3:</b> We are on a journey to understand and magnify self, others, and life.
<br>

<b>2:</b> We will be guided by two phrases:
Excellence is a habit and Grace under pressure.
<br>
<b>1:</b> Whenever we look at a problem, we ask ourselves: What will I do about it?
